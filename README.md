# weatherapp
A Django-React weather app allows users to search for city weather information in real-time. The frontend, built with React, provides an interactive interface to input city names, while the backend, powered by Django, fetches weather data from a weather API and sends it to the frontend. The app displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions in a user-friendly dashboard.
